<p>William James Moriarty lives as a regular noble while also being a consultant for the common folk to solve their problems. However, deep inside him lies a desire to destroy the current structure that dominates British society. In the late 19th century, the British Empire has become a global power.<br><br>

He is a cold, brilliant, and calculating villain, the “Napoleon of crime” who keeps the hero on his toes at all times. Because Moriarty's background is inconsistent in the Doyle stories, it is easy to reinvent him, as Ryosuke Takeuchi and Hikaru Miyoshi do in Moriarty the Patriot.<br></p><hr>
