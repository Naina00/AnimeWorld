<h1>History</h1>
<center> <img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/a1.webp"> </center>
<p>The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1917. The first generation of animators in the late 1910s included Ōten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kōuchi and Seitaro Kitayama, commonly referred to as the "fathers" of anime. Propaganda films, such as Momotarō no Umiwashi (1943) and Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei (1945), the latter being the first anime feature film, were made during World War II. During the 1970s, anime developed further, separating itself from its Western roots, and developing distinct genres such as mecha and its super robot subgenre. Typical shows from this period include Astro Boy, Lupin III and Mazinger Z. During this period several filmmakers became famous, especially Hayao Miyazaki and Mamoru Oshii.<br><br>


In the 1980s, anime became mainstream in Japan, experiencing a boom in production with the rise in popularity of anime like Gundam, Macross, Dragon Ball, and genres such as real robot, space opera and cyberpunk. Space Battleship Yamato and The Super Dimension Fortress Macross also achieved worldwide success after being adapted respectively as Star Blazers and Robotech. The film Akira set records in 1988 for the production costs of an anime film and went on to become an international success. Later, in 2004, the same creators produced Steamboy, which took over as the most expensive anime film. Spirited Away shared the first prize at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival and won the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while Innocence: Ghost in the Shell was featured at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.<br><br></p>

<h1>Why is Anime So Popular in Japan?</h1>
<center> <img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/a0.jpeg" </center>
<p>In the west, we associate anime with Japan and – almost – Japan with anime. It’s a massive part of their cultural industry – and is perhaps the country’s third-largest industry. This makes it, obviously, pretty mega, bringing in nearly twenty billion dollars a year.<br><br>

Yet, the success of anime across the world is one of the most amazing things about this genre. Apparently, sixty percent of all animated television shows across the world come from Japan. The anime industry in China is absolutely huge, whilst, in the west, various channels and services distributing anime have made it ever more popular.<br><br>

Over the years, channels like Cartoon Network – with Adult Swim and Toonami – and now anime streaming sites such as Crunchyroll and Funimation have brought this medium to an ever-growing audience. These days, over one hundred thousand people attend America’s annual anime convention.<br>

<h1>Anime in Japanese Culture?</h1>
<center> <img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/i02.jpeg"> </center>
<p>Yet, so the history goes, Japanese anime was originally marketed incredibly aggressively to a global audience – precisely because there weren’t enough anime fans in Japan.<br><br>
But, now, anime is pretty much everywhere in that country. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, six of the ten highest-grossing movies were anime, whilst Spirited Away remains the biggest-selling film in Japan. Seventy percent of Japanese DVD sales are also anime.<br><br>
Anime is visible everywhere. In adverts, in branding for water and snacks, on trains, school buses, and in airports. It has become a ubiquitous cultural force that has come to define the country itself.<br><br>
Yet, it goes without saying that not everyone likes it. And, even in the world of anime, many people are concerned about the commercialisation of the form. With every successful anime undergoing adaptation into a light novel, a live action film, video games, merchandise, music, and manga, the industry is sort of all encompassing.<br><br>
In the same way that Disney makes a lot of the products that it sells alongside the films themselves – there is a Pokémon theme park just as there is a Disneyland – anime does the same.<br>
