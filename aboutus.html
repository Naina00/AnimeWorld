<p>Hello and welcome to Anime World<br><br>

Seeing how you’re reading this post, you must be interested in writing for us (or not?) Whatever the case, I’m glad to have you here.<br><br>

If you are indeed considering to write for us, and you’d love to voice your thoughts and opinions to the world through us, I invite you to write an anime guest post on AW.<br><br>

Also, we don’t have the budget for paying you for your guest articles. But there are other perks of guest posting which I’ll cover a little later.<br><br></p>
<center> <img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/gif2.webp"></img> <center>
<p>However, if you are interested in becoming a long time author, feel free to mail me your previous works at my mail id along with a list of anime you’ve watched. If you pass some of our criteria we will be more than happy to hire you as an author.<br><br>

But hey, if you’re not worried about the pay, then feel free to hit me up if you want to publish a guest post.<br><br><hr><br><br>

<h2>What kind of posts do we accept?</h2>
<center><img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/gif3.gif"></img></center>
<p>If you’ve got anime recommendations, reviews, quotes, news, anime games list/review, or literally anything related to anime and Otaku culture, make sure to pitch your work. I’ll publish it after a quick review (Seriously, I’ll publish anything as long as it means new content for me lol. Just kidding, I’ve got a few criteria as well. I’ll tell ya more about it down below.)<br><br>

Also, feel free to write a short bio about yourself and your website (if you have one) at the end of the post, but it is understandable if you want to maintain your anonymity.<br><br>

Or, of course, you can hit me up on the contact page first and discuss what you’d like to write.<br><br>

Note: Your article might be edited for SEO purposes.</p><hr><br><br>

<h2>Criteria</h2>
<center><img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/gif4.gif"></img></center>
<p>Your content must be strictly limited to anime and anime related stuffs.<br><br>

A blog post, excluding image related posts (like anime quotes), must have at least 600 words.<br><br>

Your post should not contain anything that includes hateful commentary or explicit sexual content (but mild, ecchi stuff are okay.)<br><br>

Your content should be unique and must not be published elsewhere.<br><br>

The topic you choose must not already be covered on Anime Everything Online.</p><hr><br><br>

<h2>What do you gain?</h2>
<center><img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/gif6.gif"></img></center>
<p>Nothing really.<br>

You get to promote yourself and your site or your social media. Feel free add links to your social media pages at the end of your article.<br><br>

You are free to include your affiliate links in the post (but make sure you don’t plug it in unnecessary places and is not linking to anything offensive. It is okay as long as it doesn’t disturb the readers.)<br><br>

You can include the links to your guest posts on your portfolio if you’re a freelance writer.</p><hr><br><br>

<h2>How to Apply?</h2>
<center><img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/gif5.gif"></img></center>
<p>if you’re interested, let me know through the contact page or you can mail me at nainatanty919@gmail.com or hit me up on my Instagram @naina_tanty and I’ll guide you through the process ^^ (I might not respond on my Instagram pages due to the volume of messages I get there, so sending out a mail is preffered.<br><br>
