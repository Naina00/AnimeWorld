<center><img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/bloggif1.gif"></center>
<p>As far as “anime blogging”, it’s been more than 12-14+ months since I started. Though this isn’t my only website.<br><br>
   Over the years I’ve seen countless bloggers fail, quit and shutdown their websites. Maybe I should write about the reasons bloggers quit another day?<br><br>
   But for now, I’ll tell you how to start an anime blog in 7 simple steps. No BS, no fluff, just straightforward tips that work.<br><br>
   Use these tips as a guideline (there’s no such thing as “the only way” to do it). And don’t expect the same “stale” advice given by other so called bloggers.<br><hr></p>
<h2>1. What will you write about?</h2>
<center><img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/bloggif.gif"></center>
<p>Seriously, WHAT will you write about?<br><br>
   Lets make things easier for you. Here are the topics in the anime industry:<br><br></p>
<ol>
  <li> Anime reviews.</li>
<li>Product reviews.</li>
<li>Recommendations.</li>
<li>Top 10 content.</li>
<li>figurines.</li>
<li>How-To guides.</li>
<li>Day in the life posts (related to anime).</li>
 <li>Anime news.</li>
<li>Inspirational posts (like Anime Motivation).</li>
 <li>Life lessons (like Anime Motivation).</li>
 <li>Anime quotes.</li>
 <li>Anime cons and events.</li>
<li>Cosplay.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s a good idea of what the anime industry looks like when it comes to blogs and websites. For the most part it fits into these 13 topics and subjects.<br><br>
   When I started this blog, inspirational and motivational content was my main choice. Hence the name: Anime Motivation.<br><br>
   Tons of fans come here to read up on anime quotes and similar content everyday. My secondary topics are recommendations and how to’s, related to products and the industry.<br><br>
   So whatever you decide on, have a main topic and secondary topics. Otherwise you’ll grow bored of writing about ONE thing.<br><br>
   Having secondary topics gives you room to breathe every now and then. And can even spark ideas and creativity. And more importantly: will prevent you from wanting to shoot your blog in the head and give up on it.<br><br><hr></p>
<h2>2. What are your skills?</h2>
<center><img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/bloggif3.gif"></center>
<p>This point makes me laugh, because it’s so easy to miss.<br><br>
I see bloggers in all types of industries doing this wrong. And then wonder why they have 0 shares on any given blog.<br><br>
I don’t want you to do this wrong, so ask yourself: What are my skills? It takes self-awareness to understand this.<br><br>
Don’t lie to yourself, it will only do more harm than good.<br><br>
I’m a natural at writing, so it’s no surprise the written word is my main choice.<br><br>
My secondary choice is audio.<br><br>
What is your choice?<br>
Are you skilled at writing?<br><br>
Are you charismatic , comfortable or good in front of a camera? (video).<br>
Do you have a good voice? Are you good at communicating and speaking? (Audio).<br>
Whatever your top #1 skill is in these 3 areas, choose 1. And then let that be your guide.<br><br>
You can have a secondary choice as well. Anymore than that and your results might suffer.</p><hr>
<h2>3. Choose a blogging platform wisely</h2>
<center><img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/blog2.jpeg"></center>
<p>It’s simplistic to see blogging as “having a website” but that’s just not true.<br>
There are multiple ways to blog without even owning a blog or a website.<br>
Here’s a good range of blogging platforms to choose from:<br></p>
<ol>
   <li>Blogger (owned by Google).</li>
   <li> WordPress (my favorite).</li>
   <li> YouTube (video blogging).</li>
    <li> Vimeo (video).</li>
       <li>SoundCloud (Podcasts).</li>
      <li> Stitcher (Podcasts).</li>
       <li> Writing guest articles for anime websites.</li>
     <li>Medium (free blogging platform).</li>
     <li>Quora (not the best, but it has a written platform for blogging).</li>
     <li>Periscope (live streaming video content).</li>
 </ol>
<p>As you can see, there are more platforms than you realized. Even some bloggers don’t know of these platforms.<br>
Going back to point #1, use your skills and apply them to whichever platform is best for you.<br>
And maybe have a secondary platform, as well.<br><hr>
</p>

<h2>4. Consider running your own website with webhosting (WordPress)</h2>
<center><img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/bloggif.gif"></center>
<p>If you choose WordPress, which I recommend more than anything, you’ll need to pay for web hosting.<br>
It might sound complicated now, but trust me it’s simple once you understand.<br>
The basics look like this:<br></p>
<ol>
   <li>You choose a domain name (url).</li>
<li>You pay a company to “host” your websites images, files, domain name and content.</li>
<li>You install WordPress.</li>
<li>You’re given a url to login.</li>
<li>And then you set up WordPress.</li>
<li>After that – you’re done!</li>
</ol><hr>
<h2>5. Have a schedule and stick to it</h2>
<p>Assuming by now you’ve fully set up your blog, you need to stick to a schedule.<br>

One of the biggest mistakes bloggers make is DISAPPEARING for months or even years. Only to come back and start writing again, when nobody even cares about them anymore.<br>

Imagine if Beyonce stopped making music for the next 10 years. Would you still be a fan? Hmmm.<br>

That’s how you’ve got to look at keeping a schedule. Even if it’s once a week, once a month or once a day, stick to a schedule.<br>

People appreciate consistency.<br>

Personally I’ve stopped following people who were inconsistent, simply because I’d forgotten who they are.<br><hr></p>
<h2>6. Learn the basics of digital marketing, then use your strengths</h2>
<p>Unless you don’t plan on promoting your blog, you need to know HOW to promote it.<br>
   Digital marketing is slang for “promoting things on the internet”. That’s how you should look at it.<br>
   Here’s a couple of methods and things to learn:<br></p>
   <ul>
   <li>SEO (search engine optimization).</li>
   <li>SEM (advertising on search engines).</li>
   <li>Social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc).</li>
   <li>Email marketing (newsletters).</li>
   <li>Communities (forums, Reddit, etc).</li>
   <li>Guest blogging (writing for other sites).</li>
   </ul>
<p>That pretty much covers the basics. The point of this is to choose the methods that match your skills.<br>

      If you don’t, then you’ll struggle to get even 10 followers to care about your content.<br>

<h2>7. Watch A LOT of anime</h2>
<center><img src="/Users/nainatanty/Downloads/blog7.jpeg"></center>
<p>You won’t find these points being made on similar posts about starting an anime blog.<br>

   If you don’t watch a lot of anime:<br>
   
   You’ll have less to blog about.<br>
   Less knowledge on the topics you choose.<br>
   Less to offer in terms of approach, style and opinion.<br>
   And you won’t be able to produce an endless amount of content in the long run.<br>
   That doesn’t mean you have to watch 1000 anime shows. Not even close.<br>
   
   But knowing 100 or 200 shows. Or even 50 is a big advantage, because those 50 shows will give you all kinds of ideas for content.<br>
   
   I’ve made around 5-7 posts on this blog based on 1 anime series: Madoka Magica.<br>
   
   That’s a lot of posts for one anime series, and there’s more I can do with that 1 anime as well.<br><br><hr></p>
